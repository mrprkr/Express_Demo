<!-- ### Gulp Recipies
#### There are three main recipies in the `gulpfile.js`
1. `$ gulp`: Compiles jade/sass, moves styles inline and serves to the browser
2. `$ gulp send`: Send a preview email to the addresses listed in the `gulpfile.js`
3. `$ gulp deploy`: Uploads the `./public` folder to gh-pages for preview and distribution

<!-- ###Troubleshooting

##### Gulp command not recognised
Make sure gulp is installed by running `$ npm install gulp -g`

##### Gulp-sass throws an error
At time of writing, Gulp sass is only supported upto v0.12 of node. run `$ node -v` to check the version installed -->
